## Source Help

- [flexiple](https://flexiple.com/javascript/javascript-clock/) - Had a great thurough example and guide, with step by step help of code.

- [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-design-digital-clock-using-javascript/) - a quick pseudo code list of what I should do, without the help of an actual code. It's great as if to challenge myself on what I understand of javascript, and be able to make the clock project.

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_timing_clock) - I was able to compare to flexiple, as they were similar, only difference was on how flexiple used the meridiem on the clock, not w3school.

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_comparison) - JavaScript comparisons = The ? : Operator
